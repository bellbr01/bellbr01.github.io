  <h2>Accounting</h2>
  <p>As stated before, I am an Accounting major at Luther College. With my major, I am hoping to take the CPA exam upon graduation and become a Certified Professional Accountant at a public accounting firm. This summer I will be working at Hormel in Austin, MN as an accounting intern in Internal Audit. I will also take part in the Premier Student Program at Deloitte  in St. Paul, MN. I hope to be able to learn both the Public and Private sectors of Accounting and then decide what's the best fit for me.</p>
